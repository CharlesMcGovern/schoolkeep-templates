# Northpass Templates

Use this to edit the templates of the marketing pages for your school.

## Edit Templates

All templates are in the templates folder. You can edit the files using any text editor.
If you don't know how to edit the files you can download the Atom editor https://atom.io/
then inside the github app you can press Command+Shift+A or clicking the menu item `Repository -> Open in Atom`

## Usage

### Disclaimer

Once you’ve edited your templates we won’t support automatic updates with additional features that Northpass makes to the base templates. You will need to merge the changes into your templates directory.  Additionally, we will not be able to support the look and feel of your website.

### Templates overview

You can edit the existing templates, but there is no way to add additional
templates.  Currently there is 1 template for each page
(ie: 1 homepage template, 1 course details page template, 1 custom page template).

### Scribble

We use Scribble as our templating language.  See more here: https://github.com/SchoolKeep/scribble

Scribble provides variables so that your data can be pulled from what you've
entered into SchoolKeep.  `{{ variable_name }}` will pull the corresponding
data from what you had entered into SchoolKeep.
