# Northpass Templates

Use this to edit the templates of the marketing pages for your school.

## Edit Templates

All templates are in the templates folder. You can edit the files using any text editor.
If you don't know how to edit the files you can download the Atom editor https://atom.io/
then inside the github app you can press Command+Shift+A or clicking the menu item `Repository -> Open in Atom`

## Usage

### Disclaimer

Once you’ve edited your templates we won’t support automatic updates with additional features that Northpass makes to the base templates. You will need to merge the changes into your templates directory.  Additionally, we will not be able to support the look and feel of your website.

### Templates overview

You can edit the existing templates, but there is no way to add additional
templates.  Currently there is 1 template for each page
(ie: 1 homepage template, 1 course details page template, 1 custom page template).

### Liquid

We use Liquid as our templating language. See more here: https://shopify.github.io/liquid/

Liquid is used to load dynamic content on the school website. Using variables will pull your data from Northpass.
